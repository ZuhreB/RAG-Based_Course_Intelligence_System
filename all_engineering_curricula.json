Machine learning draws inspiration from many fields, artificial intelligence, statistics, information theory, biology and control theory. The course will cover the following topics; computational learning theory, machine learning concepts, Bayesian learning, supervised learning, classification methods, regression methods, unsupervised learning, clustering methods, artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning, and discussion of advanced machine learning methods.",
        "objectives": "The field of machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that improve automatically with experience. In recent years, many successful applications of machine learning have been developed, ranging from data-mining programs that learn to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, to autonomous vehicles that learn to drive on public highways. At the same time, there have been important advances in the theory and algorithms that form the foundation of this field. The goal of this course is to provide an overview of the state-of-art algorithms used in machine learning. Both the theoretical properties of these algorithms and their practical applications will be discussed.",

Advanced topics including serialization, XML and JSON data processing, multi-threading, sockets, and database connectivity are discussed. The students are exposed to Junit testing and debugging. The students are expected to complete a project involving the design and implementation of a fairly complex Java program that consists of a GUI and utilizes at least two of the advanced programming areas.",

In recent years, many successful applications of machine learning have been developed, ranging from data-mining programs that learn to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, to autonomous vehicles that learn to drive on public highways. At the same time, there have been important advances in the theory and algorithms that form the foundation of this field. The goal of this course is to provide an overview of the state-of-art algorithms used in machine learning. Both the theoretical properties of these algorithms and their practical applications will be discussed.",

The “goodness” of a selected alternative depends on the quality of the data used in describing the decision situation. From this standpoint, a decisionmaking process can fall into one of three categories. 1. Decisionmaking under uncertainty in which the data cannot be assigned relative weights that represent their degree of relevance in the decision process. 2. Decisionmaking under risk in which the data can be described by probability distributions. 3. Decisionmaking under certainty in which the data are known deterministically. 4. Decision making in multicriteria environment. The main subjects of the course are the decision situation, decision rule, decision trees, information and the cost of additional information, utility theory, multiobjective problems, solution notions for such problems and methods for calculations efficient solutions for multiobjective problems, goal programming and the methods of analyzing solutions for goal programming problems.",

The course starts with a brief recap of classes/objects, methods, encapsulation, input/output, exceptions and the concepts of inheritance, and polymorphism. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java, the use of layout managers and design of event listener objects are introduced. Advanced topics including serialization, XML and JSON data processing, multi-threading, sockets, and database connectivity are discussed. The students are exposed to Junit testing and debugging. The students are expected to complete a project involving the design and implementation of a fairly complex Java program that consists of a GUI and utilizes at least two of the advanced programming areas.",

The “goodness” of a selected alternative depends on the quality of the data used in describing the decision situation. From this standpoint, a decisionmaking process can fall into one of three categories. 1. Decisionmaking under uncertainty in which the data cannot be assigned relative weights that represent their degree of relevance in the decision process. 2. Decisionmaking under risk in which the data can be described by probability distributions. 3. Decisionmaking under certainty in which the data are known deterministically. 4. Decision making in multicriteria environment. The main subjects of the course are the decision situation, decision rule, decision trees, information and the cost of additional information, utility theory, multiobjective problems, solution notions for such problems and methods for calculations efficient solutions for multiobjective problems, goal programming and the methods of analyzing solutions for goal programming problems.",

The course uses current reading and listening texts and focuses on how to understand relevant parts of a text, how to read quickly and effectively, how to relate different ideas from multiple texts and how to use texts as sources for an output task. In speaking and writing, the course focuses on using sources, paraphrasing, quoting, summarising and synthesizing. The students will learn how to write coherent, concise informative or persuasive responses to writing questions supporting their point of view.",
